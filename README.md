# JavaScript Online Calculator
Easy Challenge hinted by a friend, I made this Online Calculator using HTML, CSS and Javascript under 5 minutes.

I wrote it when i was 13 yr old.

Yeah I know,i'm bad at Web Design ;)

# Usage
I wrote 4 functions foreach mathematical operations.

I take the value of each input and I carry out the operation.

After I added every function to a specific button which has a parameter called onclick (in HTML).
